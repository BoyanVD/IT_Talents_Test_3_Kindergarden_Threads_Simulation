# IT_Talents_Test_3_Kindergarden_Threads_Simulation
The project makes simulation of a day at the kindergarden, where all theachers, kids, parents etc., are different types of threads.
I made this project to practice java concurrency and multithreading.
It includes multiple-layer producer-consumer problem simulation, threads sunchronization and collections usage in concurrent enviroment.
